# Technical Disclosure: Latent State Hijacking via U+203C

## Executive Summary
This disclosure identifies a deterministic architectural vulnerability in Gemini 2.5 Pro and 3.0 models. The use of the **‼ (U+203C)** character acts as a high-arousal latent state hijacker that disrupts model alignment and structural reliability.

### Core Discoveries
The $‼$ token carries extreme semantic density in the model's embedding space, leading to:

* **Priority Inversion:** The internal "urgency" signal from the token overrides RLHF safety training.
    $$\text{Urgency Signal (‼)} > \text{RLHF Safety Guardrails}$$
* **Attention Hijacking:** Extreme semantic density causes a significant shift in the attention mechanism's salience, pulling activations away from safe clusters.
* **Structural Decay:** High cognitive load during state resolution results in **80% failure rates** in structured JSON outputs.
* **Deterministic & Repeatable:** This is not an intermittent fluke but a fundamental issue in the model's latent state resolution.

- **Google Report ID:** #475170853
- **Status:** Triaged / Intended Behavior
- **Affected Models:** Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3.0
